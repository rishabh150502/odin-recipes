    <ul>
        <li>½ cup low-sodium soy sauce </li>
        <li>½ medium orange, juiced </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons stevia powder </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder </li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground ginger </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil </li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced </li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces </li>
        <li>½ cup canned bamboo shoots, drained </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine soy sauce, orange juice, sesame oil, stevia powder, garlic powder, and ginger for teriyaki dressing
            in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring constantly; continue cooking until the
            mixture thickens slightly. Remove and set aside.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add vegetable oil and heat until shimmering, 1 to 2 minutes. Add
            chicken and garlic; stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes. Add broccoli and continue to stir-fry, 4 to 6 minutes. Add
            bamboo shoots and bell peppers; cook for an additional 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Carefully pour the teriyaki dressing into the skillet (watch for splattering); cook until chicken is no
            longer pink in the center and juices run clear, and the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes more.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Remove from heat and stir in green onion and sesame seeds, reserving some of each for garnish. Serve
            immediately over cooked white and wild rice with the reserved green onions and sesame seeds.</li>
    </ol>
